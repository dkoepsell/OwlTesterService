IV. Legend Layout

BVSS diagrams include a top-left or sidebar legend with all used icons, temporal key (timeline axis), and optional metadata:

Time Axis: Horizontal (left-to-right) or vertical (top-down)

Color Legend: Optional

Role tags (e.g., Plaintiff, Buyer) using ◌ + label within or beside ●
