BFO Visual Syntax System (BVSS)
A General Visual Language for Basic Formal Ontology

I. 🎯 Purpose
The BFO Visual Syntax System (BVSS) provides a standardized, intuitive, and expressive visual language for representing the full set of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) entities and relations across domains. It enables the creation of legible, interoperable diagrams that support teaching, modeling, and ontology validation.

II. 🧩 Entity Vocabulary
Each BFO entity class is represented using a unique symbol and visual style:

BFO Class	Symbol	Style	Example Label
Independent Continuant	●	Solid black circle	Agent, Molecule
Material Entity	■	Filled gray square	Rock, Cell
Immaterial Entity	□	Hollow square	Spatial Region
Object Aggregate	⬛	Thick square	Team, Flock
Fiat Object Part	▭	Hatched rectangle	Hemisphere
Dependent Continuant	◌	Dashed circle	Color, Role
├ Specifically Dependent	◌ + anchor	Anchored to 1 host	Hue of Red Apple
├ Generically Dependent	◌ + ↺	Migrates hosts	License Text
Quality	◦	Tiny dot	Redness
Function / Disposition	⚒	Hammer icon	Fragility, Digestion
Process (Occurrent)	⟶	Directed arrow	Digestion
Process Aggregate	⟶⟶	Double arrows	Symphony Performance
Spatiotemporal Region	◬	Ring overlay	Interval t₀–t₂
Temporal Instant	| (tick)	Timeline marker	t₁

III. 🔗 Relation Vocabulary
BVSS uses stylized lines and arrows to represent BFO relations:

Relation	Symbol	Description
is_a	↑ solid line	Taxonomic subtype
part_of	→ dashed line	Mereological part
participates_in	⇨ double line	Continuant involved in process
has_role / has_quality	→ small arrow	Dependent continuant relation
inheres_in	⇒ thin arrow	Quality inheres in material entity
located_in	→ (pinhead)	Spatial/temporal inclusion
realizes / is_realized_by	↻ curved arrow	Disposition realized by process
has_participant	⇐ reverse arrow	Process includes participant

IV. 🗂 Legend Layout
🕒 Time Axis: Horizontal (left-to-right) or vertical (top-down)

🟥 Color Legend: Optional and configurable

🏷️ Role Tags: Use ◌ + label near ● (e.g., Plaintiff, Buyer)

V. 🧪 Use Cases by Domain
A. ⚖️ Legal Domain: Criminal Trial Lifecycle
● Court (Independent Continuant)

◌ Due Process Right (Role)

⟶ Trial Opening (Process)

■ Complaint Document (Generically Dependent)

⟶⟶ Trial Phase (Process Aggregate)

→ Evidence supports Legal Fact

B. 🧬 Biomedical Domain: Enzymatic Reaction
● Enzyme (Material Entity)

◌ Catalytic Activity (Disposition)

⟶ Hydrolysis Process

→ Substrate is_part_of reaction

↻ Catalytic activity realized in Hydrolysis

C. 🛠 Engineering Domain: Machine Lifecycle
● Robot Arm (Material Entity)

◌ Gripping Function (Function)

⟶ Object Transfer (Process)

→ Gripper is_a Tool is_a Device

D. 🎓 Education Domain: Classroom Setting
● Student (Independent Continuant)

◌ Learner Role

⟶ Lecture Event (Occurrent)

■ Syllabus Document

→ participates_in(Student ⟶ Lecture)

VI. ✅ Benefits
Enhances ontological transparency and pedagogy

Bridges textual and diagrammatic ontology modeling

Facilitates competency questions, OWL modeling, and logic testing

VII. 🛠 Tool Support (Planned)
🧩 PlantUML + BVSS icon library

🔄 GraphML export templates

🧠 OWL → BVSS visualization plugin (e.g., for Protégé)

📘 BVSS is proposed as a universal visual syntax standard for ontology-driven modeling across law, medicine, education, and beyond.
