Test Your FOL Expression
Enter your First-Order Logic expression:
forall x,t (instance_of(x, continuant, t) -> exists y,t2 (instance_of(y, process, t2) & participates_in(x, y, t2)))
Use BFO standard syntax with instance_of(x,Class,t) format for class membership. Note: Both formats are supported: instance_of(x,Class,t) and traditional Class(x).
