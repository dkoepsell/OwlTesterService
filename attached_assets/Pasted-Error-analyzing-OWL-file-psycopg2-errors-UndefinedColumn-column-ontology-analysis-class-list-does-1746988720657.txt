FOL-BFO-OWL Expression Tester
Test Your FOL Expression
Enter your First-Order Logic expression:
e.g., forall x,t (instance_of(x,continuant,t) -> exists_at(x,t))
Use BFO standard syntax with instance_of(x,Class,t) format for class membership. Note: Both formats are supported: instance_of(x,Class,t) and traditional Class(x).
