# FOL-BFO-OWL Tester

## üß† Introduction

**FOL-BFO-OWL Tester** is a comprehensive web service for validating and analyzing First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions and OWL ontologies using the **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)** framework.

Designed for **ontology developers, researchers, and students**, this tool ensures that your logical expressions and ontological structures conform to BFO standards, revealing structural and semantic issues and offering real-world implications of your ontologies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üîç FOL Expression Testing

1. **Enter a FOL Expression**: Input your expression in the provided field.
2. **Test the Expression**: Click `Test Expression` to analyze it.
3. **Review Results**: The system will validate syntax, check for BFO compatibility, and highlight issues.
4. **Fix and Refine**: Use the feedback to adjust and correct expressions.

### üß© Ontology Analysis

1. **Upload OWL File**: Load your ontology into the system.
2. **Review Structure**: View analysis of class hierarchies, axioms, and logical relations.
3. **Explore FOL Premises**: Extract and inspect FOL expressions derived from your ontology.
4. **Generate Implications**: Use AI to infer real-world consequences based on your ontology's logic.

### ‚úÖ The system checks for:
- FOL syntax correctness
- BFO class and relation recognition
- Use of non-BFO terms
- Structural errors in logic
- Ontology consistency and contradictions
- Class hierarchies and relationships
- Axiom validity and coverage
- Logical entailments and real-world implications

## üß± About BFO

The **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)** is a domain-neutral top-level ontology used to support data integration and interoperability across disciplines.

BFO distinguishes between:
- **Continuants**: Persistent entities (e.g., objects, qualities, functions)
- **Occurrents**: Temporal entities (e.g., events, processes)

## ‚úçÔ∏è FOL Syntax Guide

| **Logic** | **Symbol** | **Example** |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Universal Quantifier | `forall` | `forall x (Human(x) -> Mortal(x))` |
| Existential Quantifier | `exists` | `exists x (Student(x) & Happy(x))` |
| AND (Conjunction) | `&` | `Tall(John) & Strong(John)` |
| OR (Disjunction) | `\|` | `Happy(Mary) \| Sad(Mary)` |
| NOT (Negation) | `~` | `~Raining(today)` |
| Implication | `->` | `Wet(Grass) -> Rained(Recently)` |
| Biconditional | `<->` | `Bachelor(x) <-> (Man(x) & ~Married(x))` |

> üí° *Use lowercase for variables, uppercase for predicates/constants.*

## üî§ FOL Notation Formats

### ‚úÖ Traditional Notation (Simpler)
```text
forall x (Human(x) -> Mammal(x))
```

### ‚úÖ BFO Standard Notation (Recommended)
```text
forall x, t (instance_of(x, Human, t) -> instance_of(x, Mammal, t))
```
- Uses `instance_of` and time-indexed class membership.
- Supports temporal reasoning in line with BFO structure.

> The system **auto-detects** the format and provides context-sensitive feedback.
