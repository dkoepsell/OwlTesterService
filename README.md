About FOL-BFO-OWL Tester
Introduction
The FOL-BFO-OWL Tester is a comprehensive web service designed to validate and test First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions against the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) classes and relations, as well as analyze complete OWL ontologies for consistency, structure, and real-world implications.

This tool helps ontology developers, researchers, and students check if their logical expressions conform to BFO standards, identify potential issues in their formulations, and understand the practical implications of their ontological structures in real-world scenarios.

How It Works
FOL Expression Testing
Enter a FOL Expression: Type or paste your first-order logic expression in the input field.
Test the Expression: Click the "Test Expression" button to analyze your input.
Review Results: The system will parse your expression, check it against BFO classes and relations, and display detailed results.
Fix Issues: If any problems are detected, you can use the provided feedback to refine your expression.
Ontology Analysis
Upload OWL File: Select and upload your OWL ontology file.
Review Analysis: The system automatically analyzes the ontology structure, consistency, and logical relationships.
Explore FOL Premises: View the First-Order Logic premises extracted from your ontology.
Generate Implications: Generate real-world implications based on your ontology's logical structure.
The system checks for:
Syntactic validity of FOL expressions
Recognition of BFO classes and relations
Identification of non-BFO terms
Structural issues in expressions
Ontology consistency and contradictions
Class hierarchies and relationships
Axiom validity and completeness
Logical implications and entailments
About BFO
The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a top-level ontology designed to support information integration, retrieval, and analysis across diverse scientific domains. BFO serves as a foundation for building domain-specific ontologies in a way that supports interoperability.

BFO divides entities into two main categories:

Continuants
Entities that persist through time while maintaining their identity, even as they undergo different sorts of changes. Examples include objects, qualities, and functions.
Occurrents
Entities that happen or unfold in time. Examples include processes, events, and temporal regions.
For more information about BFO, visit the BFO official website.

Ontology Analysis Features
Our system provides comprehensive ontology analysis capabilities, allowing you to:

Upload and Analyze OWL Files
Upload your OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology files for comprehensive analysis, including:

Class hierarchy extraction
Relationship mapping
Axiom identification
Statistical analysis of ontology structure
Consistency checking using reasoners
FOL Premises Extraction
The system extracts First-Order Logic (FOL) premises from your ontology, providing:

Translation of OWL axioms to FOL statements
Logical interpretation of ontology relations
Human-readable descriptions of logical structures
Identification of logical patterns and rules
Real-World Implications Generation
Using advanced AI technology, the system generates practical real-world implications from your ontology:

AI-powered interpretation of logical structures
Generation of concrete scenarios demonstrating logical rules
Domain-specific examples of how ontology principles apply
Explanations connecting scenarios to specific premises
History and Analysis Tracking
The system maintains a comprehensive history of your ontology analyses:

Track all uploaded ontologies
Review previous analysis results
Compare different versions of ontologies
Access previously generated implications
Build a knowledge base of ontology insights
Recent Updates
Based on valuable user feedback, we've made the following improvements to the system:

Added default BFO classes and relations when ontology file can't be loaded
Fixed the LogicParser initialization to properly use imported module
Implemented proper extraction of terms from BFO-style expressions
Added missing methods for ontology analysis functionality
System now properly recognizes both traditional and BFO-style notation

FOL Syntax Guide
When writing First-Order Logic expressions for the tester, use the following syntax:

Logical Operator	Symbol	Example
Universal Quantifier	forall	forall x (Human(x) -> Mortal(x))
Existential Quantifier	exists	exists x (Student(x) & Happy(x))
Conjunction (AND)	&	Tall(john) & Strong(john)
Disjunction (OR)	|	Happy(mary) | Sad(mary)
Negation (NOT)	~	~Raining(today)
Implication	->	Wet(grass) -> Rained(recently)
Biconditional	<->	Bachelor(x) <-> (Man(x) & ~Married(x))
Variables are typically represented by lowercase letters. Predicates and constants typically start with uppercase letters.

FOL Notation Formats
The system now detects and supports both traditional and BFO standard notation formats for FOL expressions:

Traditional Notation
The legacy format where class membership is represented by applying a predicate to a variable:

Continuant(x)
This format is simpler but less semantically precise for complex BFO ontologies.

Example:

forall x (Human(x) -> Mammal(x))
BFO Standard Notation (Recommended)
The BFO-preferred format that uses the instance_of relation to represent class membership with temporal contexts:

instance_of(x, Continuant, t)
This format is more expressive and handles temporal aspects of BFO entities effectively.

Example:

forall x,t (instance_of(x, Human, t) -> instance_of(x, Mammal, t))
 New Feature: The system now automatically detects which format you're using and provides appropriate guidance. While both formats are supported, we recommend using the BFO Standard Notation (instance_of) for more precise and temporally-aware expressions.
Project Information
This web service is based on the FOL-BFO-OWL-tester by dkoepsell. The original Python script has been adapted and extended to provide a web interface and API for testing FOL expressions against BFO-OWL guidelines.

Technologies used:

Backend: Flask, Python, NLTK, Owlready2, PostgreSQL Database
Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
AI Integration: OpenAI API for generating real-world implications
Reasoners: HermiT and Pellet for ontology consistency checking
